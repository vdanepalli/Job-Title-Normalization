## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt` or installable via `pip`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vdanepalli/Job-Title-Normalization.git
   cd Job-Title-Normalization
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the notebooks and follow the instructions for preprocessing data, training models, and generating recommendations.


### Example Workflow

1. Data Input: Input raw job titles and resumes.
2. Normalization: Run the job title normalization process to standardize titles.
3. Skill Recommendation: Generate skill recommendations tailored to the normalized job titles.
4. Resume Feedback: Analyze resumes and provide actionable feedback for improvement.
